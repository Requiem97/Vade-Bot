You know how it's almost always funny to see a professional screw up a basic thing he knows how to do by heart without even thinking about it?
It's like having an umbrella in your hand but using your bag to cover yourself from the rain.
It's like wearing a cap backwards but using your hands to shield yourself from the blinding sun rays.
It's like shooting at your own goal thinking it was the opponents'.
It's only ever funny if the blunder wasn't crucial. This is the only kind of schadenfreude I won't regret feeling for anyone.
And depending on the person committing the fail, it's either outrageously funny, incredibly stupefying, head-scratchingly annoying,â€¦
Or downright cute.
That was a flustered face I'm gonna remember for a while.
