Just as easy it is to create life, such is it simple to take it.
Just as easy it is to speak, such is it simple to own your words.
Just as easy it is to connect with someone, such is it simple to exclude them from yourself.
Just as easy it is to forge a strong tie with someone, all the easier to ruin their life.

No.
Now is not the time.
Nor the place.
Nor the mood.
Pressing on from here ascertains your doom. Should you dare, then partake in a ritual of the shadows with me. Offer up your woes, and find that the truth will bestow upon you suffering imperceivable.
Come with me for an answer, and forget not one of your ownâ€¦
