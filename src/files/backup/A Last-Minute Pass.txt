Get me back to a bedridden state.  Productivity is apparently there.
The video wasn't appealing enough. They said it was the choice of music. I swear it wasn't a meme song.
This was the first time we lined up together as a coherent unit. It was a bad idea to decide to free some crystals in that instant, though. But I found myself doing so due to the deafening engine and their discussions over an event I will not pursue.
Like a scripted sequence after idling about, the silence timed in well.
It was the moment.
I bring up my trump card.
I proclaim around to everyone my love for the very object that allows me to be strong and connected with everything. But has she not ever wondered about the vowel juxtaposition of name a latched onto it? I recall telling of this story to her but for that bulkier portable version of that very object.
And so I probed.
Maybe the setting was too casual to take the hint. I hope the relatively persistent urging to think about it was something.
Denseness varies from obliviousness and the lack of comprehension. Persistently urge this one. It's the last week.
