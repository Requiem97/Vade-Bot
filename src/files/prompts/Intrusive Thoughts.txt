I once thought of jumping from top floors, yet I have a fear of heights.
There was a time I was urged to stretch my limbs at an approaching train. Glad to know I didn’t rather jump.
It came to me once to break everything I saw as I got handed a nasty loss. If only I wasn’t sentimental.
I thought of preventing a crime once. Instead I caused it.
Upon the small number of encounters we have, the simulation once created a car accident. The sudden movement of my fragile body to protect your sturdy figure wasn’t enough to keep you alive.
In another, a bandit who would shoot anyone who defied him. A few centimeters determined your life and death, while mine was assured.
One more, an underwater affair. Those last few moments showed the desperation in me as I tried to kiss you. A minute later, the flood dissipates, yet I was left drowning in regret.
And the worst of them all, me cancelling your migration by force.
Whether I kill your hopes.
I kill your dreams.
I kill all those who planned to take you away from me.
I kill everyone you’ve ever loved.
Or I kill you.
…because killing myself was guaranteed.
