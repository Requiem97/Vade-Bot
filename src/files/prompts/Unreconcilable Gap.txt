This should be a conscious effort. The success of the past will mean nothing if even one day, you would choose to slack off. It’s not enough that I listened.
I had an entire week back to normality with the situation. Despite a productive outing the other day, we’re back to dozes and snores this day. If I were to blame something else, it would be the seating.
It should work better to talk across each other because we see would each other eye-to-eye. Maybe the forced skinship of the tight space of the transport proves more conducive for conversation. It’s probably to not be rude towards the other people suffering the same fate as us.
A new phase of the plan involves actually going crazy. Being unpredictable was the advise. It was time to move, before I lose this chance once more. But because of the short gap of seats, the silence was too much to handle. Before the short slumber, our eyes suddenly meet. I clearly had something to say, but I shook it off, with you dismissing it very quickly on.
Waking her up before my stop proved to be a challenge which I failed. How else can I do a surprise attack?
