To think I thought you knew more than I did. You would be well more aware that it takes a higher level of knowledge to cure a disease than to make it. The worst mistake an amateur curer can make is to actually create that of which he was bent to destroy. Or you could just be doing this to initiate a topic. Commendable if so.
It also had to take actually playing a game in front of you to get your attention further. Glad to know how me getting lost was to your enjoyment.
But alas, not even this Tier 2 spell can cure the ailment that the bystander casted. Way to go to for him to bring up the topic of your departure. Definitely thought you kept it a secret. Though, I wouldn’t have been able to do it myself.
Education wasted as work immediately ensues.
A new goal of Square internship.
And a course in gaming all for 1 million euros.
Good luck to your newfound main story quest, adventurer.
