Let’s look at a setup for a trio that’s going home after a long day of work. There’s always a structure as to how the talk of the day will go by.
There will always be one person who will start the topic by asking a stupid or absurd question. And either the rest are too dumbfounded by the query, or at least one other passes their vast knowledge or their unmistakable passion for it.
Because of a Venn diagram of likes among three people is less likely to meet requirements for all, there will always be a time where only the overlap between two people will arise, and only throughout further conversation will it determine whether it will stay locked or reach the common ground.
Take Pokémon for example. All of them like it. But only A and B care about competitive Pokémon. But only B and C have the Nintendo 3DS to be able to play it, experiencing it first-hand. Seeing this, at least one person wil try to flex his knowledge like the Pokérus to get back on general track. Or at least one person is going to ask about the specifics of breeding, citing his experience of four days wasted breeding for a Pokémon with certain stats.
Or there will always be that one guy who stays away from the conversation by dozing it off. Or that guy who runs out of stupid questions or serious inquiries.
