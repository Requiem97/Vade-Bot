Blackouts cause the death of productivity in the urban setting. I should have remembered that when the electrician went off to fix the circuit breaker at the building across ours.
Everyone else was rushing to a place with power. I wouldn't have minded the wait that started from all the way to another line.
But as I say that the journey is more memorable than the destination, if your journey companion is spaced out to even be called a part of the quest, where are the memories? Curse the electrician who got back before the ride.
I want my hour back. I could have used it to do something worth my while.
