Someone besides myself is counting me down. If only I was stricter with myself, I would have gotten this over with in no time. But I wasn't, and there's no point frowning upon it. I was given a second chance, and I had all the leeway to leverage on it.
The emotion I felt grew worse and worse every second over the course of the new age, the second chance I had been given in order to sort things out. The severity was intense enough for me to doubt everything I've bottled up for nearly a year. If it wasn't for the timely help of my closest friend and the constancy of my newly-found disciple in the process of application for the group I've found myself accustomed to, I would have surely surrendered to the negative vibe that was the entirety of the week in question.
I've told myself that the Tuesdays were my only hope if I wanted to advance the plot, seeing as our schedules only matched up at that point. But with the group's weekly assemblies happening on that very day, how was I going to fare? The meetings take long enough for her to consider getting fetched by her uncle, completely disregarding any sort of waiting I would do just to catch her alone. On this day in particular, I feared the same. And those fears were definitely up.
Three days from the anniversary of discovery, and five days from the deadline. There was no other option for me. I needed to wait it out. On paper, I'm a member. They would surely allow me to crash at the meeting. So, directly after Hapon 123, because it would still be my natural route to go home, I accompanied the two, her and her best friend since our Anthro 1 days, towards the tambayan. Under a provable pretext of my desire to not go home immediately, I made myself busy. As she left to buy lunch with her fellow applicant, I continued the final touches to the cleaning and organizing of the entire place: the cabinet that the president begged the college to allow inside the premises. The last thing left to do is clean up the boxes and throw away the clutter at the storage area beside the tambayan proper. In 30 minutes, she returned, lunch in hand, and sat down at the tambayan steps to eat. The place was crowded like that during the time.
The entire 40 minutes was pure idling. Someone complimented my pink shorts. Someone was talking about having no Internet, so she decided to stay and chill in the tambayan for a while. My groupmates in Kas 114 were writing the script for our KasPlay Epiko thing on Friday. The department representative was playing random chill tunes and chatting with some of the applicants, her and my disciple included. I was never a man of words, so listening was my forte. I juggled trying to listen in on all the conversations happening at once, because they were interesting for me as a person with little experiences in life. I found myself eventually staring at her too much that it garnered the attention of the dept rep, who was actually staring at me and laughing silently. It was an odd sight, so I asked him about it.
All he said in response was "'yung ngiti mo, kakaiba."
I was making a remarkable smile as I stared at her staring at nothingness? I thought I was smiling as normal. It caught me so off-guard that I covered up my face, looked away, and became extremely self-conscious with my smile, hopefully to no one's notice except his jesting glare.
After calming myself down, even more down time. Everyone was doing their own thing, and I was back to observing. Enough to observe that she was preparing to leave. She just signed out and is packing her stuff. Apparently, the meeting today was optional for the applicants. Lucky me, but I didn't look like I was ready to leave, and I didn't bother asking her if she was leaving, so I excused myself to everyone else first, seeing as the same applicant she bought lunch with is keeping her from leaving. Making encounters look like coincidences are things I've done one too many times for many people, so doing this feels like a sort of second nature when I want to make things seem unplanned. I'm not sure if this is a skill I should be proud of, though.
I waited long enough in a place she wouldn't bother to look, and when I confirmed she was heading towards the jeep stop in front of the Pavilion, I slipped in a chance to move in, acting oblivious like something I definitely wasn't expecting.
"Akala ko hindi ka pa aalis."
"Akala ko nandun ka pa."
And with just a few words exchanged, we defaulted into our usual set-up. Taking the SM North jeep and keeping the talk alive with random topics until one of us (that's me) drops off at Trinoma. As someone I haven't talked to in a while, my first instinct was to ask how she was. She says she's gotten busy, but she's managing. Her Monday part-time only starts next week, so she can only get busier.
"Kaya nga hindi na ako pupunta sa mga review classes for N2," she mentions, thinking she still had to explain herself after missing the diagnostic exam last Saturday.
"Because the weekends are time for your acads?"
"At gusto ko rin maglaro sa weekends!"
Well, I'll always give time for that.
After me mentioning the insane difficulty spike of N2 from N3 and the fact that I think I failed the test, an SM jeep arrives, dropping off passengers. I silently prayed for the jeep to have enough space for us both after a flock came before our entry. Thankfully, there were seats left nearest to the driver. We sat across each other, with each stop squishing her as more and bulkier people sat across her side. It was definitely difficult to interact that time. I asked her how she was faring with the org application process, and she mentions that it's not a hassle except for the sig sheet. No difficulties and awkwardness present, good signs for me that she's doing okay fitting in. I also only got to tell her now how I'm technically a member of the org thanks to the inner workings lead by the president and the publicity committee head.
About us entering the SC area, she started to doze off, with people still pressing her towards the corner. I still couldn't help but get angry at myself whenever I allow this dead air to happen. I still lament on how uninteresting I am that I cannot contribute anything to add to the topics to keep the talking alive. But of course, I always think that she's working so hard that she'll need all the rest she can get. I'll let this slide just because the more important talking will be happening later. So, the only thing I can do is stare at her like I always do, my chin resting on both my palms since I'm also animation-locked in place while being the guy people give their payment to for the driver. She would wake up at random intervals, while I was silently hoping she would notice me just looking at her without a thought in the world but just "She's really cute when she sleeps."
The jeep got gridlocked in front of SM as usual this time of the afternoon, and this was the time she finally woke up. Upon a quick check of where we were, she immediately asked me, because I didn't go down to Trinoma as the default dictated,
"Hindi ka bumaba doon (sa Trinoma)?"
"Nah, I have agenda sa North."
She simply nodded, still half-asleep. A state I clearly remember her in during that time she forewent sleep to study for our final exam in Hapon 112. As majority of people jumped ship from the completely stuck jeep, so did she decide to alight, with me tailing directly. I took a slight distance from her to psyche myself up for the thing I have planned.
I can do this. I can't let today go to waste.
A hop step to catch up, and she asks,
"Ano nga ‘yung bibilhin mo sa North?"
"Hindi, hindi, may mga gagawin. I have two agenda sa North–"
I coughed slightly, choking on my spit for a few seconds.
"No, wait, three. I have three things to do in SM today."
"And those would be…?"
I didn't answer yet as we both crossed the road. The stoplights weren't working, and the guard wasn't doing anything to assist us, so we winged trying to cross. I tried maneuvering to her left side to parry oncoming traffic, but to my surprise, she also weaved to my left, just as a taxi halts near her. I'm guessing she moved there since the entrances were sex-segregated.
I tried to bring the agenda topic back before we parted ways, so I digressed as me converged at the front entrance.
"I hope I'm not keeping you from your schedule or anything. Are you planning to do something today?"
"Yeah. I have a paper, well, mini-paper for 130 due tomorrow and a report for 165 also due tomorrow."
"Harsh. But, seriously, mini-paper for 130? On what?"
"Comparative ng phonology of Iraya."
"Wait, comparative how?"
"Phono according to two sources and dun sa recording namin."
"That sounds fun." If you can't tell already, that's looking like a filler phrase when I use it. A personal note on being careful when I use it, though.
And of course, I just had to ask.
"How's 6 hours of Sir Ricky?"
She let out a defeated chuckle. She had no choice at all but to take those classes to catch up due to the Department's blind eye.
"Puro exercises kami, both sa 120 at 165. Sa 165, depende sa mood ni Sir at kung nandyan si JP (Alcantara, a Miraya speaker) (but I don't know him personally, though, so go figure)."
"Ahh, classic moody Sir," as I let out a defeated sigh of my own.
Riding the escalator, she takes the lead, since the walk-stand rule is being implemented.
"'yung report namin sa 165, Ibaloi phonology na."
"Ah, right. Reminds me to coordinate with Sander's group, and you with Peteena's."
We continued our walk towards the outer walkway.
"Pupunta pa ba kami ng Baguio?" a legitimate concern by someone in the lower class.
"Hindi na ‘yan. Sobrang lala ng condition doon." An honest remark. Our informants just got back electricity recently, so I wouldn't expect a lot more especially another typhoon's coming up.
"Baka raw aalis kami ng October? Early, late October?"
"Hindi na talaga. Super alanganin. Tapos November dapat paper na lang? I'm actually questioning kung makakagawa pa kami ng grammar sketch eh."
We were now on the walkway heading towards Grass. Let's get back to telling her what's up, shall we?
"Ah, right. About the things I have to do. The first one is about these SM GCs I have. I really don't know where to use them." Plus the fact that I just received another one as a reward for answering a 10-sentence essay for a survey.
"Pwede sa mga department store."
"Dun lang?"
"As far as I can remember."
Halfway there.
"The second one is for my friend. Magpapatingin siya para sa bagong salamin."
A much delayed half-truth. I already accompanied my friend to do so some weeks ago in Landmark in Trinoma.
"Ahh, nice. Kakapalit ko lang din ng sa akin."
I then figured that her red glasses were new. If I remember correctly, she had a more circular black one just last semester.
"Ano na bang grado ng salamin mo?"
"175. Hindi naman nagbago."
"The higher, the worse, right? My friend's at 400, I think."
"I had a classmate nung high school who had 700. Pinapakitaan namin ng ‘o, ilan to', at talagang wala siyang makita," all while doing the proper hand gestures.
And finally, the end goal. The pushed back checkpoint nearing the Grass parking lot. I asked why they moved it, and she replied that the guards were getting soaked in the rain at the old checkpoint, so they moved it to somewhere with more cover.
The time was around 4:30 pm. The aftermath of the rain turned the sunlit sky a faint crimson that will only be visible during the entire sequence. The guardrails we were close to were covered in droplets which persisted onto the metal as circles shaped by perspective with a fixed point miles above the both of us. The only people in that moment besides the persons involved were the lone security guard expressionless in his duty to simply stand there and permit or deny entry to the parking lot, and only a handful of people passing by. Definitely better than a crowd of people that we both know.
We were only meters from the exit, with the guard standing motionless with his stick for inspection. She was about to hit me with the goodbye for the day. I was not gonna have that.
At least, not yet.
"Gab, wait."
Her sights were on the road ahead, her body facing to that direction, ready to leave, until I mentioned those words. She turned slightly to face me.
"…my third agenda is you."
Taken slightly aback, she looked downward. She was all ears this time.
"…okay, so how do I start…?" I thought out loud. The not so scenic urban setting was my unconscious best friend as when I'm at a loss for words, I look far.
After a recognizable beat, it was definitely YOLO.
"I know you've been busy recently, but I just want you to know that we're here– I'm here to support you and every way that I can."
"Wow, wait. Wala naman akong problema talaga, though," she shakily clarified and looked at me with her usual "wow" motion of leaning back and smiling greatly while staring intently at me, a clear misunderstanding of intentions on my end. Good start…not.
"Nonono I mean, when you feel stressed, feel free to just rant, let it all out. It's just that… I know we haven't been talking a lot recently especially this sem…"
But really, I've always been worried sick about you. Something I wasn't able to say despite all that.
I started to lose my grip on what I wanted to say. I was unconsciously holding myself back from segueing from that sentence to saying that I like her. There felt something amiss for me. This was a dead air characterized by the usual ums and uhhs, alongside some awkward laughing, and all these happened with my unsteady gaze moving from her and the guardrails that I was starting to harass.
"I think I know where this is heading…"
If that's not a signal yet, then I don't know what is.
"Oh, really now?" accompanied by even more awkward laughing.
"Yeah. You're a good friend, you know?"
Can I cue even more awkward laughing? I expected a similar response, but that would be after I said anything!
"Well, I'll still go ahead and say it."
Simple is best. I didn't even try to hold her hands just like how I thought I'd do in my simulations.
"Gab, I like you. I really do," as I stared into those bespectacled eyes for the last time.
And her "formal" answer to that,
"Thank you, but I'm sorry. I don't feel the same way."
And all I can do was nod.
…well, until my curiosity got the better of me and approached the next dead air according to one of my first simulations.
"How obvious was I?"
"Actually, medyo nahalata ko na rin. I didn't want to assume, pero may mga naririnig na rin kasi ako."
Oh, how scary word of mouth and gossip is. This is a prime example of how far word travels. It reaches to the target before you even sent your own word. That's as equally scary as with a story being transmitted from channels and back to him, already twisted beyond what was actually reported.
"May mga nadulas nga kanina eh. And very recently," she continued.
"What??"
This was the start of my impulse taking over. I was getting louder. It's like the entire confession is over, and I've returned to how I usually talk with people, in a loud and obnoxious way. "Sino??"
"Si Nollyn."
Upon mention of her soul sister, I burst out laughing. Legit /laugh , I tell you. It was during a brief moment upon entering the tambayanrlier. She greeted Nollyn joyously, a semi-sarcastic "hisashiburi" that sounded hints serious. Nollyn reacted in a cutesy, over-the-top way, as if they haven't seench other in months. "Hisashiburi, aitakatta! Itoshi teru!" as she suddenly jumps from her seat to hug the dumbfounded gamer girl whon only let out a soft sigh,lling Nollyn heavy. I made no intention to hide my laughter during the entire QTE,facepalming at the scene that unfolded out of gayness.
"Si Sean din."
I don't know what he did or how he accidentally splurted it in the normal conversation we had last Friday, but if she says he had a hand, all I can do is believe it and shrug.
I tried to continue the hint of casualness by doing something off-script. And yes, at least I had a flow that went on, albeit poorly.
"I've been trying since JLPT to tell you how I really feel. I really wanted to blame Jethro, but you know, he was just there."
She genuinely laughed at that remark and remembered how Jethro can be at times. I don't see him around anymore, but from their stories in the part-time work, I can tell they're all enjoying it despite the stress.
And let's get back to script. Return to the Move monologue. Saying something out of all the things I want to say highlights which ones are of more priority to convey. The same principle applies with forgetting something you thought you should have remembered, plus the concept of selective memory.
"When you told me you were moving, I felt both happy and sad for you. Happy and excited because you were going through a new endeavor in life, but sad because you were going. And too soon. Kaya nung nalaman ko na hindi ka pa aalis…"
I felt like I was given a second chance. Another opportunity to be with you at least presence-wise. A last time for us to be classmates from the most basic of Hapon to the nitty-gritty social issues there in the land deemed perfect by many other nationalities. Again, I did not say.
"I felt… odd. Confused. It felt to me that due to everything happening with you right now, it was harder to talk to you and approach you." What I actually got to say.
"I actually felt that from you. I felt the distance and tension that you were feeling. I'm happy for you that you finally got it out of your chest. With you finally saying it, it clears up a lot of things."
That was an equally casual response. It's as if she took the words right out of my mouth. She followed it up with mentioning how observant she can be with different things around her. "I'm not dense at all."
That was the most relieving thing she's said. Ever. This was also a wake-up call for me to value speed and aggression more, just like my playstyle. Letting food stay in the pan too long will definitely burn it.
"You're a really good friend, and I value everything you've done for me."
Impulse continues.
"I think that should be the real end goal, and I'm glad you see me that way," as I continue to smile like I've never before.
"But yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not looking for a relationship at the moment."
"And neither was I when I fell for you."
Stop it, impulse… Misconstructions are hard to undo. She looked at me puzzled.
"Well, liking someone just happens, right? One just finds out through something crazy like seeing you in my dreams and such."
She was caught a bit off-guard with my remark, laughing it off cutely but awkwardly. It was weird hearing it, but it was more cute for me than awkward, so I'll take it.
Impulse took the wheel again.
"I've burdened a lot of people with this. I've overthought about this to them for too long. Plus, I can't unthink the fact that if natuloy ako sa exchange, I wouldn't have gotten these feelings for you."
A beat, as if it was natural for me to pause there for the misleading weight of that last utterance.
"But I'm glad I didn't. I wouldn't have Overwatch now if I did."
"Yeah, true," followed by a short laugh.
It didn't occur to me then to ask her out to play again sometime. We're still 2-3 in the 1v1 duels, her in the lead, of course. Maybe it's both due to her being busy to actually think of playing on PC again and my rig lacking a power supply. Impulse wanted to drone on about Rei and my struggle of not being able to play, but after allowing to at least mention the device with her namesake and missing it so much, I then asked if she also remembered about how I chose to name my devices. Reiterating her being not dense, she told me she figured after piecing one and one together.
Alright, impulse. Your time is up. She has to go do her reports. I've kept her long enough. I've thanked her too many times for me to remember each time I did. She must be getting tired of that.
"But I hope this doesn't change anything between us…"
"Yeah, of course."
Did I really need that much reassurance? Or maybe I just wanted hear some sort of yes in this scenario? I don't know, but the clearer everything is, the better.
Speaking of clearer, has she ever gotten to use the mouse I gave her– damn it, impulse.
"Also, don't think less of the mouse I gave you. Nagagamit mo ba ‘yun?"
"Minsan. Nasa bahay lang naman ‘yun."
No need to ask her if it double clicks already. She legit has to go. A 10-hour schedule winding down to 8:30 pm will kill anyone, and she's going to need all the time she can get to prepare.
But I know she can do it. She's strong. She's hardworking. Studious. Passionate with work. Filled with the willpower of a guardian angel.
Gabu-chan'nara, dekiru.
I wanted to say that, but I guess I'll tell her that in some other setting.
"Alright, I won't keep you for longer. Good luck with tomorrow!"
"Thanks! See you tomorrow! Bye~"
A farewell in her mellow-energetic tone that I've remarked to myself as a very cute melodious sound to hear no matter what scenario.
She had her bags inspected by the still guard who only moved his hands to assess her items and went on home, only looking forward, never glancing back. All my wandering eyes could do was follow her slow motions as she navigated through the rest of the walkway, into the parking lot where she escapes my line of sight.
I took a moment to assess what just transpired. I leaned at the guardrails, looking towards the place where she stood just a couple of minutes ago.
I remember the imagery. It was a sight I won't be able to forget. A faint crimson light emanating from a star behind the clouds complementing her maroon polo that's arguably long for her, and a slightly puffy or baggy pair of black pants, completed by her apricot-schemed rubber shoes. Her short brown hair in a style that covered her right eye if she let it down fully waved softly at me, all at the will of the cool breeze. Her round face and even puffier cheeks puffed as her peach-colored lips worked out a smile, and eventually, to utter out a line I expected her to say 50%.
"Thank you, but I'm sorry. I don't feel the same way."
And the first thing I felt after realizing that it has come to pass?
I felt free.
Like in an instant, all the anxiety disappeared.
All the overthinking. All the stressing. All the negative vibes. Gone.
Of course I felt sad that I got rejected. Of course I felt disappointed because the confession turned out somewhat lacklustre when compared to the countless simulations I've done in my head. But I kept forgetting that life is not a monologue. The lengthier you make a speech, the more unnatural it gets, especially in a discourse setting.
I also feel bad for misreading her and her being troubled over a lot of things. I think I have this problem of forgetting the basics of everything when things start to get complicated. I forgot about her unshakable will. I forgot she was a person, too, who'll respond accordingly whether or not I finish my monologue.
But one thing's for sure.
I'm more proud of myself for going through with the confession than I am sad about getting rejected.
And I guess it goes without saying that I'm not going to give up just because I got one simple "no". That's not how love works!
Moral of the story? Never bottle up your emotions, because doing so will kill you slowly, paralysis onwards. And, act fast. The YOLO way of doing things in a sense that one should live through stuff without regrets.
So yeah.
I deserve a treat for myself.
