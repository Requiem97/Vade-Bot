It's hard to get used to the new guy. One day, you were chilling with the single person you've been with forever. The next thing you know, that's thrown out the window as the talks enter somewhere else.
It's hard to get used to the new guy. More so if he's getting more attention than the washed up veteran you call yourself. There are apparently more things to talk about with someone you've only known for a few.
It's hard to get used to the new guy. The back seat, as much as it translates to me, is not something I would like to live by. It's time I learned how to drive.
It's regretful a new guy had to come in. But I thought no regrets, self?
It's annoying that a new guy is so nice. No one can dismiss him.
Why isn't it like this when I'm a new face in a crowd?
