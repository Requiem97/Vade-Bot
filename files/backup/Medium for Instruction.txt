I've been given that advice months ago. Who would have known that it would only work now? Well, no one told me about the other closet pervert who shared her unconventional interests. And it took them more than a year to figure out their commonality.
Now she won't stop mentioning it. Not that I mind. It's livelier this way. I learn more about her this way. I do not mind either that the corruption spreads further as she becomes a medium for instruction of those the norm deems forbidden.
Kudos to the one who just came out of her closet, and congratulations to that one who can finally vent her desires out on someone who thirsts like her. You're all past redemption and salvation, but aren't we all?
