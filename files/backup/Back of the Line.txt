One can never say that there was no point in their life that they were at the rear. Even the greatest at this age is chasing the ghost in Chicago. Even the best finds someone better than him.
What happens when you're behind now rests on you. Do you embrace your tag of last place? Or does the lack of any achievement whatsoever push you to reaches you never knew existed?
I'm in a constant state of pursuit, chasing those who've gone ahead of me. So do those who I considered my equals are now leaving for greener pastures. That obligation to myself that makes me strive for improvement is now sending me flying, just like grinding the rubber out of a tire.
Can I stop looking at other people now?
