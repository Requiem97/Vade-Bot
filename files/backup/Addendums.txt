The fatigue is showing in my physique. The luster that was once my exuberant energy is slowly losing shade. There's really no reason to take care of myself anymore if they keep stacking up like this.
After enduring half the force, nothing much has alighted from me. Yet it's as if I feel more burdened. More worried.
It was another hot day in this desert-like wasteland. Hell on Earth has never been such an accurate depiction of the halls I've stayed in for years after the decision. Upon finishing the report to our superior, I was made to report by my partner on my own progress. Am I still going to continue even if the chances equaled zero?
Having a broken resolve cannot be overshadowed by a flaming courage. And how cruel can the tides be for sending out the very thing I was made to report about to pass by right in front of both of us. The target has exited our line of sight.
On the urge of my partner, I ran swiftly chasing the target.
Only to realize the target was slowly coming back.
With a tall, frizzy-haired, buff-bod red flag carrying it like a standard.
That definitely sounded my retreat.
Quick.
Well, that just invalidated my farewell.
And replaced with a cheerful goodbye as if another meeting was assured.
The only thing assured is my breakdown from the remaining half of the force. Don't you dare fucking add on to that.
