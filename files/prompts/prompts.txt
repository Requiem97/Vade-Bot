Get me back to a bedridden state.  Productivity is apparently there.
The video wasn't appealing enough. They said it was the choice of music. I swear it wasn't a meme song.
Like a scripted sequence after idling about, the silence timed in well.
It was the moment.
I bring up my trump card.
And so I probed.
Maybe the setting was too casual to take the hint. I hope the relatively persistent urging to think about it was something.
The fatigue is showing in my physique. The luster that was once my exuberant energy is slowly losing shade. There's really no reason to take care of myself anymore if they keep stacking up like this.
After enduring half the force, nothing much has alighted from me. Yet it's as if I feel more burdened. More worried.
Having a broken resolve cannot be overshadowed by a flaming courage. And how cruel can the tides be for sending out the very thing I was made to report about to pass by right in front of both of us. The target has exited our line of sight.
On the urge of my partner, I ran swiftly chasing the target.
Only to realize the target was slowly coming back.
Don't you dare fucking add on to that.
This is the only kind of schadenfreude I won't regret feeling for anyone.
That was a flustered face I'm gonna remember for a while.
All of these flashed by me during that shared moment.
A shared moment I wanted but never in that manner.
Meddling, unwavering, killing the mood.
Now I know.
I will miss you.
And you will be remembered in the same way I remember those that come to pass.
Thanks! That's it. We're done.
Can I stop looking at other people now?
It was definitely a bad idea to report in today. But I had no choice.
Yet even as fate has been cruel to me for so long, I can feel it giving me a pass.
And to that I ponder. Do headaches turn me into a talkative mess? Then I wish I would have been sick sooner!
Yes. I'm used to standing as an idle observer. I was taught that if I had nothing useful to add to the conversation, I should keep my mouth shut.
Maybe it's time to advance and get this over with.
Maybe it's time to pull out from this operation.
Let's do this.
Let's end this.
No one is true to what they say anymore.
That or the assumption is too unclear.
I still feel betrayed.
I once thought of jumping from top floors, yet I have a fear of heights.
There was a time I was urged to stretch my limbs at an approaching train. Glad to know I didn't rather jump.
It came to me once to break everything I saw as I got handed a nasty loss. If only I wasn't sentimental.
I thought of preventing a crime once. Instead I caused it.
Upon the small number of encounters we have, the simulation once created a car accident. The sudden movement of my fragile body to protect your sturdy figure wasn't enough to keep you alive.
In another, a bandit who would shoot anyone who defied him. A few centimeters determined your life and death, while mine was assured.
One more, an underwater affair. Those last few moments showed the desperation in me as I tried to kiss you. A minute later, the flood dissipates, yet I was left drowning in regret.
And the worst of them all, me cancelling your migration by force.
Whether I kill your hopes.
I kill your dreams.
I kill all those who planned to take you away from me.
I kill everyone you've ever loved.
Or I kill you.
…because killing myself was guaranteed.
The worst mistake an amateur curer can make is to actually create that of which he was bent to destroy.
I want my hour back. I could have used it to do something worth my while.
It's annoying that a new guy is so nice. No one can dismiss him.
Why isn't it like this when I'm a new face in a crowd?
It's not enough that I listened.
Making encounters look like coincidences are things I've done one too many times for many people, so doing this feels like a sort of second nature when I want to make things seem unplanned. I'm not sure if this is a skill I should be proud of, though.
Well, I'll always give time for that.
I can do this. I can't let today go to waste.
After a recognizable beat, it was definitely YOLO.
And all I can do was nod.
Impulse continues.
Impulse took the wheel again.
Alright, impulse. Your time is up.
Did I really need that much reassurance?
I felt free.
I deserve a treat for myself.
Oh, how I’ve missed it.
I’ll wake up exhausted for sure.
The last thing I might find is a mirror which I can’t see my reflection on.
Can I stop looking at other people now?
There were suddenly things to do. Things to see. Stuff to talk about. Stories to tell. Avenues to explore. Moments to look back and laugh about. Memories to make.
Good night and goodbye for today.
All the more I lament.
All the more I cling to hope.
All the more I hold back the tears.
